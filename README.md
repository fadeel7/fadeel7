## About

On a mission to become a full-stack engineer who builds complete solutions from database to deployment. Learning by doing, shipping by iterating, and growing through every line of code written.

**Current Focus:** Mastering the full spectrum—frontend polish, backend logic, cloud infrastructure, and everything in between.
