##  What I Do

I'm on a mission to master cloud architecture and DevOps. Right now, I'm deep in the AWS ecosystem, building serverless applications, automating infrastructure, and learning how to make systems that don't break at 3 AM.

**The Real Talk:** Started my cloud journey in 2024. Every day I'm either breaking something in AWS, fixing it, documenting it, or building something new. That's how you learn.

##  Current Projects

###  AWS S3 Automated Backup System
**Event-driven disaster recovery solution**

Built a serverless system that automatically backs up files across AWS regions. When you upload to S3, Lambda kicks in, copies everything to a backup bucket in another region, and shoots you an email. No servers, no manual work, just automation.

**Tech:** AWS Lambda • S3 • SNS • Python • CloudWatch

**What I learned:** Event-driven architecture, cross-region replication, IAM policies, and why CloudWatch logs are your best friend.

##  How I Work

**My approach is simple:**

→ Break things down until they make sense  
→ Build small, test often, deploy confidently  
→ Document everything like I'll forget it tomorrow (because I will)  
→ Automate anything I do more than twice  
→ Learn in public, fail fast, iterate faster

##  Why Cloud?

I got into cloud because I'm fascinated by how modern systems scale. The idea that you can write code, deploy it, and have it automatically handle millions of requests without thinking about servers? That's powerful.

Plus, there's something satisfying about building infrastructure that just works, even when things go wrong.

##  Let's Connect

I'm always down to chat about cloud architecture, automation, or how you solved that weird AWS permission error.
